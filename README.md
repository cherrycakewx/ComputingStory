Time to start with the story shall we?

Once upon a time, in a village far far away...
lived a girl, who's hair was never straight.
It looked like the wind was always blowing,
and without anyone knowing.
She was ostracized for her looks,
and ridiculed for her love of books.
Once a confident girl was now ashamed.
Was she pretty, or was she fake?
She avoided going out, and hid in her house,
for no one would want to see her.
For ten years she remained like this,
learning off of books.
She learnt how to do poetry, 
and loved her romance books.
She longed for someone to see her that way,
like she was their world.
But she knew no one would ever know 
the girl behind the door,
whose hair flowed like the breeze
and hides in her stronghold.
